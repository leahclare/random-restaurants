Randomly selecting a new restaurant in Vancouver every few weeks.

## About
My boyfriend and I want to try new restaurants in Vancouver, BC. This project will automatically select a new, random restaurant every 3 weeks and book us a table for 2. It will make sure the selected restaurants have a good variety (i.e., I don't want to eat sushi four times in a row) and that they have at least a 4/5 star review on Open Table.
